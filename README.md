# Hack Project
The hack project is a way of using many tools like nmap, arp, dig, host and ping in one place. It is easy to use and install.

## Installation
To install the hack project, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myshy13/hackProject/refs/heads/main/hackInstaller)"
```
follow the prompts to complete the installation. It is recommended to run the installer with sudo privileges to ensure all components are installed correctly. In order to have the best experience, it is recommended to allow us to install the updater (hackUpdater) and also make sure that you have all dependencies installed (curl, nmap, arp, ping, dig). If you do not have these dependencies installed, the installer will refuse to install the program.
